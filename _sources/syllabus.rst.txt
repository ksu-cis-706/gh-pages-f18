   <h3>CIS 706: Translator Design I, Fall 2018</h3>

----

.. include:: def.rst

Purpose
*******

The course will teach modern compiler techniques applied to general-purpose
programming language.
The goal of the course is to give students a working knowledge of the
foundations, tools, and engineering approaches used in developing formal
language translators.
The emphasis is on the construction of compilers to position students to build
translators for little languages in their careers.


Course Topics
*************

Compilers and interpreters, including description of languages, finite state
scanners, parsing, symbol tables, syntax directed semantics, code generation,
and static analysis.


Philosophy
**********

This course is based on a course that was originally designed by
|Laurie J. Hendren| and |Michael I. Schwartzbach| which has been taught at a
number of universities over the past decade.
The course received a significant update by |Robby| and |Matthew B. Dwyer| in
2005 with respect to the projects and the tools that are used for compiler
implementation; this update achieves a modernization of compiler construction
technologies.
This is primarily an introductory compiling course that has been designed to
recognize that most people will not build a large application like a compiler
from scratch and that people learn by doing.
Towards this end, the project for the course involves the enhancement of an
existing compiler code base.
Students will be given a working compiler and will be required to extend it in
significant ways.
This will give them insights into how a compiler is designed and written that
they can leverage for their enhancements.
While serving this purpose, the course does present significantly more content
on static analysis than is typically found in an introductory compiling course;
thus it can serve as an effective introduction on advanced topics for graduate
students.

Grading Policy
**************

The course :ref:`schedule` page gives the due dates for all of the homework.
This is to facilitate your planning and time-management.
Given this, we expect assignments to be turned in on the due date unless prior
arrangements have been made; late assignments receive a reduction of 1% of the
total possible points for each hour after the due date/time.


Grading Scale
*************

Course grades are absolute, that is, there is no curve, and will be calculated
based on your overall percentage on assignments as follows:

* A: 90% -- 100%

* B: 80% -- 89%

* C: 70% -- 79%

* D: 60% -- 69%

* F: below 60%

There is one additional constraint on your final grade.
To receive a letter grade of A, you must achieve at least a B on the exam.
Similarly, to receive a B you must achieve a C, C you must achieve a D on the
exam. 


Computer Access
***************

This course involves a lot of programming, and it makes significant use of 
software tools. 
Many of these can be accessed by you (for free) and installed on your own 
machine.
If you prefer, we have everything you need on our CIS department machines so you
can get an account on our machines.
See the :ref:`notes` page for information on how to get an account and use our
machines.


Attendance Policy
*****************

In general, there will be NO make-up quizzes or exams!
Special consideration will be given in only exceptional circumstances.
Exceptional circumstances are generally limited to:

* **Emergencies:** death in student's immediate family, or 
  near-death experience of the student.

* **Non-emergencies:** certified excused absences for official university activities.

If you believe you qualify for exceptional treatment, you must notify the
instructor prior to the date of the quiz or exam to be missed.


Statement Regarding Academic Honesty
************************************

Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which 
is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one's work is
performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. 
Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the Honor System.
The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time
students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus,
and via distance learning.
The honor system website can be reach via the following URL: 
http://www.ksu.edu/honor.

A component vital to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which
applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by
students.
The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated:
"On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid
on this academic work."
A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty.
The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor
Pledge violation.


Other Administrative Issues
***************************

* **Incompletenes:** An incomplete (I) final grade will be given only by prior
  arrangement in exceptional circumstances conforming to departmental policy in
  which the bulk of course work has been completed in passing fashion.

* **Drop Policy:** It is your responsibility to drop the course if you are
  enrolled but decide not to complete the course --- there are no "automatic"
  drops due to nonattendance.
  The University allows a retake of a course with removal of the prior grade,
  at most once per course, for a maximum of five courses.
  
* **Students with Disabilities:** If you have any physical or learning
  disability which will make it difficult for you to carry out the work as
  I have outlined in this syllabus or which will require academic
  accommodations, please notify me the first two weeks of the course.

* **Harrassment:** One purpose of your education is to help you develop skills,
  approaches, and abilities that are necessary for effective teamwork, and for
  your success in your profession and as a citizen.
  It is important that you understand your rights and responsibilities regarding
  the University's Sexual and Racial Harassment policies (full text of the
  policies can be found on KSU's web site at
  http://www.ksu.edu/uauc/fhbook/fhxj.html).
  If you experience any situations, in or out of class, that seem inappropriate
  or that make you uncomfortable, a list of resources and courses of action to
  assist you can be found on the College of Engineering web site at
  http://www.engg.ksu.edu/harassment-statement.

* **Expectations for Classroom Conduct:** All student activities in the
  University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial
  Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Government Association By Laws,
  Article VI, Section 3, number 2.
  Students that engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be
  asked to leave the class.

* **Campus Safety:** Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe
  teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members.
  In order to enhance your safety in the unlikely case of a campus emergency
  make sure that you know where and how to quickly exit your classroom and how
  to follow any emergency directives.
  To view additional campus emergency information go to the University's main
  page, http://www.k-state.edu, and click on the Emergency Information button.

* **Copyright Issues:** Class and lecture notes for this course carry a
  copyright.
  Students are prohibited from selling (or being paid for taking) notes during
  this course to or by any person or commercial firm without the express written
  permission of the professor teaching this course.
